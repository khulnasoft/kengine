// Package main is the entry point of the Kengine application.
// Most of Kengine's functionality is provided through modules,
// which can be plugged in by adding their import below.
//
// There is no need to modify the Kengine source code to customize your
// builds. You can easily build a custom Kengine with these simple steps:
//
//  1. Copy this file (main.go) into a new folder
//  2. Edit the imports below to include the modules you want plugged in
//  3. Run `go mod init kengine`
//  4. Run `go install` or `go build` - you now have a custom binary!
//
// Or you can use xkengine which does it all for you as a command:
// https://github.com/khulnasoft/xkengine
package main

import (
	kenginecmd "github.com/khulnasoft/kengine/cmd"

	// plug in Kengine modules here
	_ "github.com/khulnasoft/kengine/modules/standard"
)

func main() {
	kenginecmd.Main()
}
